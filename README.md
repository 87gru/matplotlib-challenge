# Pymaceuticals Assignment

In this assignment, I prepared a data analysis on a recent animal study. In the study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

This assignment is broken down into the following tasks:

  - Prepare the data.

  - Generate summary statistics.

  - Create bar charts and pie charts using pandas and pyplot.

  - Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.

  - Create a line plot and a scatter plot.

  - Calculate correlation and regression.

  - Submit your final analysis (located at the top of the pymaceuticals.ipynb file).
